### About
Gifs are awesome.  They're portable, succinct, and hilarious.  There's only one problem with them --  all they do is loop.

Image scrub is a new way of interacting with moving images on the web.  It gives you full control of the flow of action in a sequence, allowing you to investigate specific frames, forwards, backwards, and everything inbetween.

Image scrub is in the proof of concept stage of development.
